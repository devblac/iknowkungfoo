## Intuition

How would you implement an autocomplete feature? On every letter typed, check all words on a list that start with that prefix? ðŸ˜±

Ideally organise the words by prefix, so all words with any prefix are clustered. Of course, many prefixes overlap, so we'll need a tree structure, branching on every letter of the prefix.

## Algorithm idea

- A Trie is a tree, where the actual data is in the branches rather than the node, via `dict[str, TrieNode]`, where `str` is the data.
- It starts with a sentinel root node, and words are inserted by inserting a branch per letter, or reusing it if it exists.
- Benefits: checking if a word exists in a Trie is O(w), and collecting all words with a given prefix is O(m*n) (m = longest word, n = words in Trie) but on average both m & n will be smaller.

## Algorithm

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.is_end = False # True if this node is the end of a word
        self.children: dict[str, TrieNode] = defaultdict(TrieNode)

    # Time: O(w)
    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        if word:
            self.children[word[0]].insert(word[1:])
        else
            self.is_end = True

    # Time: O(w)
    def exists(self, word: str) -> bool:
        if not word:
            return self.is_end
        if word[0] not in self.children:
            return False
        return self.children[word[0]].exists(word[1:])
    
    # Note: same as exists, but collect words instead of return True!
    def search(self, prefix: str) -> list[str]:
        if not prefix:
            return self.collect_words("")
        if prefix[0] not in self.children:
            return []
        return self.children[prefix[0]].search(prefix[1:])

    # collect all words from this node onwards!
    def collect_words(self, prefix):
        words = []
        if self.is_end:
            words.append(prefix)
        for char in self.children:
            words.extend(self.children[char].collect_words(prefix + char))
        return words
```
