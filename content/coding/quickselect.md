## Intuition

How do you get the kth smallest element of an array?

- Quicksort the array, then it's the kth! But it's `O(n*logn)`.
- Heapify the array, then heappop k times! But it's `O(k*logn)`.

Is there a faster way?

## Algorithm idea

- Start with the quicksort idea: pick pivot and partition.
- If the pivot ends at the kth position, done! Pivot is the one.
- Otherwise, do the same process but only on the left side if pivot index > k, or the right otherwise.

```python
def partition(ns: list[int], left: int, right: int) -> int:
    pivot = randint(left, right)

    ns[pivot], ns[right] = ns[right], ns[pivot]

    for i in range(left, right):
        if ns[i] <= ns[right]:
            ns[i], ns[left] = ns[left], ns[i]
            left += 1

    ns[left], ns[right] = ns[right], ns[left]

    return left

# Time: O(n) average, O(n^2) worst case with very bad pivots
# Space: O(1) in-place
def _quickselect(ns: list[int], left: int, right: int, k: int) -> list[int]:
    if left == right:
        return ns[left]

    pivot_idx = partition(ns, left, right)
    if pivot_idx == k:
        return ns[pivot_idx]
    elif pivot_idx < k:
        return _quickselect(ns, pivot_idx+1, right, k)
    # pivot_idx > k
    return _quickselect(ns, left, pivot_idx-1, k)

def quickselect(ns: list[int], k: int) -> int: # k is 1-indexed here!
    return _quickselect(ns, 0, len(ns)-1, k-1) # make k 0-indexed
```
