(not a guide for this question; only for how this question is different from all others)

⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️

## Main differences

There is a lot of overlap with Twitter:

- Timeline
- Social graph
- Search

But Instagram/Tiktok is image/video based, so:

- Bandwidth can be an issue in some localities, so on upload, producing videos at different bitrates is important. How about consistent loudness between videos?
- Access pattern (a lot in the first few days, then fade away) becomes important for cost saving.
